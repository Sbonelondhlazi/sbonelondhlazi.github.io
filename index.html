								<h2>Fictional Book Store</h2>
										
								<h3>Web Scraping using Beautiful Soup</h3>

								<p>I recently started a reading challenge; by the end of this year I want to have read at least 5 books.
									Choosing the next book can be daunting. I don't want to buy a book only to find out that it is bad.
									I want to know the reviews of the book, its cost and the place to buy it.
									<br>
									I want this process to be easy though, I don't want to browse the whole internet searching for books.
									
									To make things easy, I used Python to scrap a fictional book store. The website had 1000 books, divided into different categories. 
									These books had different reviews, prices and stock available.  
									<br>
									In a few minutes, the program scraped the entrie website and  saved the results on a csv file. 
									This dataset can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbonelondhlazi/bookstore-dataset" target ="blank" ><b>Kaggle.</b></a>
									<br> 
									With a few clicks on a spreadsheet, I can sort the data and find exactly what I am looking for. 
									Or I can do more advance stuff like inventory management if I was working for the bookstore or identification of books with low or high sales. 
									Click the link below to see the code on Github.</p>

								<h2>Factors affecting the price of diamonds</h2>
							</header>
								<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/sbonelondhlazi/diamond-dataset-analysis-using-r" target="blank" class="image left"><img src="images/diamond.jpg" alt="diamod.png" class="center" /></a>
								<p>Diamonds are minerals composed of carbon. They are the hardest naturally occuring substance known to men.
									Because of their extreme hardness, diamonds have diverse industrial applications. They are used as an abrasive in drilling, cutting, grinding and polishing.
									<br>
									But I know that most of us when we think of diamonds we think about shinny jewelry. As a miner I only get to deal with minerals during the extraction or mining phase and not with the final product. 
									We only get to see on the news if we are lucky to have knocked off early and not too exhausted, how much our end products cost.
									<br>
									We all know that diamonds are expensive, but do we really know why? So I took the liberty to analyse diamond prices and features to find just that.

									I did an exploratory data analysis whereby a dataset sourced from kaggle was used. 
									This dataset contained nearly 54 000 round cut diamonds and their corresponding prices for the year 2022. 
									These diamonds had varried prices because of their underlying properties.
									<br>
									 Click the link below to open the project on kaggle and follow along the analysis.  
									I used <b>R Programming language</b> to do data cleaning, data analysis as well as data visualisations.
